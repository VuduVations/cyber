**AES Encryption and Decryption Example**

This repository provides simple examples of how to perform AES encryption and decryption using two popular Python libraries: cryptography and pycryptodome.

Libraries Used
* cryptography: A library providing cryptographic recipes and primitives to Python developers.
* pycryptodome: A self-contained Python package of low-level cryptographic primitives.

Installation
To use the examples provided in this repository, you need to install the required libraries. You can install them using pip:

!pip install cryptography pycryptodome
